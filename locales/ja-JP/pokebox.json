  "explanation" : "Pokebattler Pokebox is an exciting new feature that lets you customize your Pokebattler experience based on the Pokemon you actually own! The Pokemon you add to your Pokebox can be used throughout the site. Be on the lookout for the box icon. A green icon means you are using the Pokebox, a black icon means you are not. You are currently limited to 50 Pokemon in your box so only load your best Pokemon (aka no Pidgeys)"
